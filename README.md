### This Python script automates the process of logging working hours to an Excel sheet. The script checks if there is an existing worksheet for the current month and either creates a new one or updates the existing one based on the date.

## Features
- Automatically logs work hours to an Excel sheet.
- Creates a new Excel worksheet for a new month.
- The program is scheduled to run daily at a specific time.
- Includes basic logging capabilities to track any errors or issues.
  
## Prerequisites
  - Ensure you have openpyxl and schedule libraries installed:
    >`pip install openpyxl schedule`
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the directory in the main() function to your desired path.
3. Run the script.
   
## Current Limitations & Future Work
This script is the effort of a  **beginner**, so there might be areas to optimize :joy:

Currently, certain values and paths are hardcoded, which will be addressed in future iterations to make the tool more flexible and robust.
